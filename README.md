# Singapore-Resale-Price-Prediction
**Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction**

**Overview**

Welcome to the Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction project! This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict resale prices of flats in Singapore. By leveraging historical transaction data, the goal is to assist potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

**Motivation**

The Singapore resale flat market is known for its competitiveness, making it challenging for individuals to accurately gauge the resale value of their property. This project aims to address this challenge by employing machine learning techniques to provide users with reliable resale price predictions based on various influential factors.

**Skills Demonstrated**

**Data Wrangling and EDA:**

*   Collect and preprocess resale flat transaction data.
*   Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and trends.

**Model Building:**

*   Choose and train a regression model using historical data.

**Model Deployment:**

*   Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit.
*   Deploy the application on the Render platform, ensuring accessibility to users.

**Domain**

The project operates within the real estate domain, specifically focusing on the resale flat market in Singapore. It involves understanding the dynamics of this market and applying machine learning to enhance valuation accuracy.

**Problem Statement**

The challenge lies in accurately predicting resale values, considering factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. The project seeks to provide a practical solution that benefits both buyers and sellers in making well-informed decisions.

**Project Scope**

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

   Collect and clean historical resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB).

**2. Feature Engineering:**

   Extract relevant features such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
   Create additional features to improve prediction accuracy.

**3. Model Selection and Training:**

   Choose a suitable regression model and train it on the historical dataset.

**4. Model Evaluation:**

   Assess the model's predictive performance using regression metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 Score.

**5. Streamlit Web Application:**

   Develop an intuitive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input flat details for price predictions.

**6. Deployment on Render:**

   Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform or any cloud platform for online accessibility.

**7. Testing and Validation:**

   Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure accurate predictions and seamless functionality.
